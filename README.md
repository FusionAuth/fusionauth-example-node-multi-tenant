# FusionAuth Node.js example

This project is a simple example Node.js application that illustrates how to integrate with FusionAuth's OAuth system using the Authorization Code grant.

## To run

This assumes you already have a running FusionAuth instance, user and application running locally. If you don't, please see the [5-Minute Setup Guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide) to do so.

* update your FusionAuth application to allow a redirect of `http://localhost:3000/oauth-redirect`
* make sure your user has a first name.
* `npm install`
* update `routes/index.js` with the client id and client secret of your FusionAuth application.
* `npm start`

Go to http://localhost:3000/ and login with the previously created user.

You should see 'Hello <name>'
